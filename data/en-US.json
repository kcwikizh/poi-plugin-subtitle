    "18": "A night battle!? How interesting... Let's do it! Please, follow me.",

    "23": "Of course, the result from this ocean navigation will not betray us. What about you, Admiral?",
    "24": "What may it be, Admiral? For you to personally summon this Katori... Eh...? Th-thank you very much! I'll... gracefully receive it.",
    "25": "First of the Katori -class training cruisers, Katori. Right, leave the ocean navigation training to me. I believe I'll be a great help in furthering what the fleet attains out of it's drills, for sure. Eh, my firepower in comparison to a battleship... is it? I wonder, tactics-wise, how it is.",
    "26": "You don't need to worry.",
    "27": "Thanks. From now on, I can navigate the ocean at any time.",
    "28": "Admiral, is there something wrong? Are you tired? If that's so, would you like to go to a sea a little faraway with Katori? When this battle is over, for sure...",
    "29": "Well... How do I put it... Sometimes it goes past one's mind... That we were fighting while escaping from the enemy fleet... Um... 'Don't worry, this is just a dream'? Yes... It's just a dream."

    "23": "Ah, I did it? Hurray! The I-400's are good, after all.",
    "24": "Admiral... did.. I do well?  Really?  You're not lying?  Well, that's great! Then, can I ask for a favour from the admiral? Yeah, just one... okay?",
    "25": "I'm I-401, the second ship in the I-400 submarine series. I'm a submarine carrier capable of making a round trip around the world, and carries 3 units of the special attack plane \"Seiran\". Yes, it's a secret strategic weapon... it's a secret, okay?",

I will protect them.",

    "46": "4 PM. How was the ranking, huh?",
    "47": "5 PM. Once you've seen the rankings, why don't you change the comments too? I mean, they do say to treasure every meeting since it's once in a lifetime... Or uh... that might be different.",

    "51": "9 PM. All right, now let's get serious!",

    "50": "2000. How was dinner? The secret ingredients were sesame oil and five-spice powder.",
    "51": "2100. Commander, I'll be washing all this dishes up first. Excuse me.",

    "42": "Admiral, it is 1200 and noon! I will bring the lunch! Please wait.",
    "43": "It is 1300. Admiral, how was Hayasui's Omurice? Hehehe, I might have gone a little over the line.",
    "44": "Admiral, it is 1400. Let's do our best for the afternoon as well.",
    "45": "It is 1500. Admiral, how about having some tea and sweets? Hayasui, will prepare them. Please wait.",
    "46": "Admiral, it is 1600. Eh? Kazahaya? No, I haven't met her in a while. I'm pretty it's been since Truk or something. I wonder if she's doing well...",
    "47": "Admiral, it is 1700. Isn't the sunset beautiful. I want to watch it forever.",
    "48": "Admiral, it is 1800. What should we do about dinner. What will be good? Hayasui, will prepare it.",
    "49": "1900! Yes! I did my best to prepare a Western style dinner. The main dish is beef steak! Yes, beef steak! It's special!",
    "50": "Admiral, it is 2000. Here is your after dinner coffee. Did the dinner suit your taste? Really!? I'm glad.",
    "51": "Admiral, it is 2100. The third torpedo squadron seems to be lively. I wonder what's going on? Eh, don't worry about it? Ah, okay.",
    "52": "Admiral, it is 2200. Eh? Taiyou-san? Yes, I believe we'll meet here someday. For sure.",

    "1": "Good Morning. The Carrier Graf Zeppelin, dispatched. Admiral, I'll be counting on you today, too.",
    "2": "Am I to depart? That would be good, yes?",
    "3": "What is it - you seem to be concerned. The flight decks are continually being maintained by myself. There is no need to worry.",
    "4": "What is the meaning of this? This is not the style of your fleet, is it? An explanation, if you'd please.",
    "5": "Hmpf. A new ship, is it? From this arsenal here, many ships have been born, haven't they. How lively.",
    "7": "Admiral, the fleet has returned... Yes. The operation is complete.",
    "8": "Admiral? Ah, you want the information verified? Roger.",
    "9": "Very well then. This is a fine plane.",
    "10": "While the Focke-Wulf also has a fine airframe, this is... Danke.",
    "11": "I wish to wash my equipment and body for a bit. That is no problem, no?",
    "12": "Apologies. I have sustained heavy damage. Please let me enter the docks.",
    "13": "Aircraft Carrier Graf Zeppelin, sortieing! Raise the anchor!",
    "14": "Excellent. You can leave this task force in my hands. Flagship, Graf Zeppelin, weighing anchor.",
    "15": "We've spotted the enemy, have we? Wonderful. Attack squadron, begin launch! Rout them!",
    "16": "Launch all capable planes! Hahaha! How thrilling.",
    "17": "Heheh... a night battle, is it?",
    "18": "Heheh... a night battle, is it?  That's great. I will show you that I, Graf Zeppelin, am no ordinary carrier. Fleet, follow after me. Pursue!",
    "19": "Ughh! What! A direct hit!?",
    "20": "A hit? The flight deck? Prevent any explosions!",
    "21": "Tch! They got me. And yet, my cannons still function! If it's a night battle, then... Admiral!",
    "22": "I'm...sinking in a fleet battle... am I? Ha...Hahaha...! Isn't that wonderful! Just what is... this feeling... heheh...",
    "23": "Deploying the Graf Zeppelin to a real battle... Was this not the natural result, Admiral?",
    "24": "Admiral? What is it? Do you have something for I, Graf Zeppelin?  Ach... this? For me? It's a beautiful thing. Are you sure? I... see.",
    "25": "First of the Graf Zeppelin-class Carriers, Graf Zeppelin. Capable of undertaking three-dimensional commerce raiding, I am a heavily-armed genuine carrier. It seems that the technology of the Japanese carrier, Akagi, was also referenced in my construction. A Japanese fleet, huh. I'm looking forward to it.",
    "26": "Yes indeed.",
    "27": "Resupply is vital. At any time, no? It's a help.",
    "28": "Admiral? Is there something on your mind? I see. That's fine then... If you wish to consult on commerce raiding then... No, if there is anything at all, it's fine to talk to me about it first.",
    "29": "Messerschmitt… that has a good airframe. The Focke-Wulf is an extremely strong fighter, too… Ja. This fleet's airframes also... A…Admiral is also quite good. N-No, it's nothing.",
    "30": "Guten Abend. Admiral, I will be serving as your Secretary-ship today. Leave it... to me.",
    "31": "0100. This is fine, correct? Leave it to me. There should be no issues.",
    "32": "0200. Yes, perfect. Admiral. Admiral? Is there anything you wish me to do? I will do my best as the secretary-ship.",
    "33": "0300. Right! You desire coffee? Leave it to me. Be ready to taste the greatest of coffees. I am quite confident when it comes to aroma and flavor of coffee.",
    "34": "0400. How is it. This is what real German coffee is. Ah! First you should enjoy the aroma thoroughly, and after that... Whatever. Please, go ahead.",
    "35": "0500. It's already morning, Admiral. Why don't you go ahead and take a shower. I will support you with the work here.",
    "36": "Guten Morgen. 0600. What should we do about breakfast, Admiral? If you are fine with something simple, I will prepare something.",
    "37": "0700. Admiral. I will leave the kaiser roll, cheese, ham and the hot coffee here. Please have some when you are free.",
    "38": "0800. Well, let us get to work. Let's start today's fleet operations. What should we do? Start off by practicing with Akagi?",
    "39": "0900. Akagi, Kaga... So that is this country's first-tier standard carriers. They do not have any catapults. They also do not seem to have any guns...",
    "40": "1000. I see aircraft that resemble my Messerschmitt. Are those not carrier aircraft? I guess they are the air force. What, that is not so?",
    "41": "1100. It is almost lunchtime. What would you want to do for lunch, Admiral? What? \"Mamiya\", you say? I have heard the rumors. Hmm...",
    "42": "1200. Hmm? So this is \"Mamiya\". The menu... has variety. What do you recommend, Admiral? Curry, you say? Okay, I will take it.",
    "43": "1300. The curry from lunch was quite a memorable dish. So the fleet here gets to have that every day, correct? I see. Hmm....",
    "44": "140... Ah, Bismarck. You were here as well. My time here is still short. Please teach me about things. Ah... That... is okay for now.",
    "45": "1500. This country's culture is unique. Admiral, I will keep it in mind to study it as much as my efforts permit. Just like that U-boot.",
    "46": "1600. So is that \"Shoukaku\", and \"Zuikaku\". They are quite the sight. So that is the \"apex\" of this country's carriers... Hmph...",
    "47": "1700. The sun is setting. The setting sun is beautiful in wherever sea you are at. What is wrong, Admiral. Is there something on my face?",
    "48": "1800. Today's dinner is... Ah, I have been invited to a \"Standard Carrier Banquet\" or the like... Admiral, would you like to join me?",
    "49": "1900. Ah, Akagi. My gratitude for inviting me to the dinner banquet. Danke. What is that? \"Nabe\" you say?",
    "50": "2000. \"Nabe\"... Is this similar to a pot-au-feu? Why is everyone surrounding the nabe? Teach me, Taihou. How should I eat it?",
    "51": "2100. That was a strange banquet. But... Yes, it was quite enjoyable. Admiral, this fleet... this place is a good place.",
    "52": "2200. Admiral, the night grows deep. Let us start wrapping up today's work. Should I make some coffee?",
    "53": "2300. Today was quite a day too. Let us work hard tomorrow too. Gute Nacht."

Eh... to put this on my finger? Ah... Ahaha... It seems a bit a bit inappropriate... but thank you for treating me so warmly!",
    "25": "I'm the 16th ship in the Kagerou-class Destroyer line. I was part of the 4th Destroyer Squadron, and was an asset to the 4th Torpedo Squadron. At Midway, I was assigned as an escort to the Nagumo Carrier Task Force. After that, I also did occasional stints at the frontline as needed...... Near the end of the war, I was involved in transportation missions in the frontline, amidst the dark sea. Together with my sister ship, Hagikaze. Remember me... and my comrades of the 4th Destroyer Squadron. Please.",

    "19": "*Scream* It hurts!",
    "20": "*Scream* Stop it!",
    "21": "Richelieu... won't sink... I won't allow it... It hurts!",
    "22": "Eh? Richelieu is... sinking? My Admiral... farewell...",
    "23": "Richelieu is? Really? Thank you, my Admiral.",
    "24": "My Admiral, what is it? Are you tired? Poor thing... Then how about... Hey, don't get carried away! Have you lost your mind?",
    "25": "I'm Richelieu, first ship of the Richelieu-Class battleships. Maybe it would be faster to say that I was the strongest battleship to be ever born in the country of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity? That's a given, especially considering those quadruple turrets... That's right, I fought on both sides during that war. Well, a lot of things happened. That's how it is.",
    "26": "This makes sense!",
    "27": "Thank you! ... Oh my, just this much?",
    "28": "What's wrong? You seem to be feeling down. Try talking to me... It's fine, don't worry about this. You don't need to concern yourself with such matters. That's how it is.",
    "29": "Those quadruple turrets really require a lot of maintenance. Richelieu isn't very good at this... Hum? Who are you? Akashi? Eh, is it really ok for you to help me with this? Alright, it's this part here...Oh my, I see. Thank you!",
    "30": "Midnight. Today, Richelieu will take care of this... That's right.",
    "31": "1 A.M. Good evening, Admiral.",
    "32": "2 A.M. Would you care for some red wine? I see.",
    "33": "3 A.M. It's already this late... You should get some sleep. Good night.",
    "34": "4 A.M. Richelieu is also a bit sleepy... *Yawn* Oh my, the Admiral's sleeping face is surprisingly cute. *Giggle*",
    "35": "5 A.M. Admiral? Admiral! Wake up! Jeez... This is troublesome.",
    "36": "Good morning! 6 A.M. Everyone, wake up! Admiral too, wake up.",
    "37": "Bon appétit! 7 A.M. I've prepared breakfast. Here you go. Here's some coffee. It's hot, be careful.",
    "38": "8 A.M. Oh my, Commandant Teste. You're early. *Giggle* Such earnestness. Have a safe trip!",
    "39": "9 A.M. Richelieu would like to take it slowly during the morning. I'll prepare myself, so wait for a bit.",
    "40": "10 A.M. Admiral, sorry to have kept you waiting. Shall we go then? Come with me.",
    "41": "11 A.M. Oh my, Yamato. You're lovely as always. Where did you bought this umbrella? Hum... I see.",
    "42": "Midday. For lunch, shall we have these \"Onigiri\" that I've received from Yamato? Where are the knives and forks? Eh? We don't need them?",
    "43": "1 P.M. It's good! This fleet's culture is pretty peculiar. But I enjoy discovering new things. I would like to learn even more.",
    "44": "2 P.M. Good afternoon! Haruna, those are impressive! Richelieu would like one of these too. Where are they selling them?",
    "45": "3 P.M. Admiral, aren't you a bit tired? I wish to rest for a bit. Is there a cafeteria somewhere around here?",
    "46": "4 P.M. *Sigh* I like cafeterias. I'm glad there's one here as well. Let's take our time, together. Thank you!",
    "47": "5 P.M. The sunset is quite pretty from this cafeteria. It's beautiful!",
    "48": "6 P.M. Let's go back and make preparations for dinner. Of course, I'll be making it. Just wait for a bit.",
    "49": "7 P.M. It's going to take a bit more time. Cooking is important. Please wait quietly.",
    "50": "8 P.M. Full course! Please dig in. Bon appétit!",
    "51": "Do you want some wine? It's fine, you can drink some more. It's still just 9 P.M.",
    "52": "It's already 10 P.M. The day went by so fast. Let's call it a day and go to sleep. Good night. I'm turning off the lights, alright? Eh?",
    "53": "11 P.M. Oh my, you're surprisingly still earnest. My admiral, thank you for your hard work. Let's give it our best tomorrow too. Good night."

    "25": "Her Majesty's ship, Ark Royal. I was commissioned as a full fleet carrier. I participated in many operations in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. It was these deadly Swordfish that ended the pursuit of that battleship Bismarck. U-boats? They're dangerous. You need to be careful of underwater enemies.",

    "29": "Ah, that's right! It's not a problem if they're outdated. If there are no enemy fighters, my Swordfish are good enough for the job. It's not performance that matters, but the results on the battlefield. Admiral? ...Ah, he's not listening huh?",
    "30": "Admiral. That's right, I'll be in charge today. Hmm, what is it? It can't be that you're not happy with that?",
    "31": "It’s 1. What?",
    "32": "It's 2. What? You couldn't be unhappy about something?",

    "36": "It's 6. Good morning. ...Fleet, all hands assemble! Alright, I remember now.",
    "37": "It's 7. Breakfast is toast with mushrooms, tomato and baked beans, hashed brown with black pudding and... How would you like your eggs?",
    "38": "It's 8. Alright, it's almost time to begin prepartions for the fleet to sortie right? Hmmm... Oh, wait... That's....",
    "39": "It's 9. There's big trouble, Admiral! Isn't that a U-boat!? It's dangerous! Fleet, prepare for anti-sub combat! My planes, begin evacuation procedures!",
    "40": "It's 10. What? I'm wrong? I-type? It's a friendly I-type submarine you say? I-I see. Now that you tell me, I can see the difference. S-so that's it...",
    "41": "It's 11. Wait a minute, what about her? Isn't she a U... What? She's a Ro-type from our fleet you say? What?",
    "42": "It is noon. I got hungry after being surprised around every corner. No, it's fine. I brought some sandwiches along just for this occasion. Warspite made them. Come on, let's eat!",

    "51": "It's 9. That was delicious, but I ate a bit too much. Hiryuu was amazing. But I'm not going to follow her example. Ah, the Italian girls are making a fuss over there. Shall I go tell them to keep it down? No?",
    "52": "It's 10. The Torpedo Squadrons in this fleet are really active at night. They're being hunter-killers huh. What? I'm wrong? Then what are those girls doing?",

Face your face this way. Alright? Close your eyes. ... Ah, you opened them! you opened your eyes! I won't do it anymore!",
    "29": "I'm bored. Harukaze, don't you get sleepy talking like that? Just look at Matsukaze. Ah. Matsukaze you're wearing that hat again. It will get in the way during combat, you should take it off. Ah what? What is it, you want to fight me? Bring it on! I'm not going to hold back!"
