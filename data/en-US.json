    "25": "First of the Katori -class training cruisers, Katori. Right, leave the ocean navigation training to me. I believe I'll be a great help in furthering what the fleet attains out of it's drills, for sure. Eh, my firepower in comparison to a battleship... is it? I wonder, tactics-wise, how it is.",

    "27": "Thanks. From now on, I can navigate the ocean at any time.",

    "29": "Well... How do I put it... Sometimes it goes past one's mind... That we were fighting while escaping from the enemy fleet... Um... 'Don't worry, this is just a dream'? Yes... It's just a dream."

    "45": "1500 hours. You want me to create a battleship with this amount of resources?",
    "46": "1600 hours. This is reckless, admiral. I was specialized for amphibious landing. Even if you spend a lot of resources for this, I....what!?",

    "25": "I am Umikaze, the Seventh of the Shiratsuyu Class Destroyer, and the First of the Revised Shiratsuyu Class. I was built according to the 2nd Naval Armaments Supplement Program. I participated in the Battle of Guadalcanal, as part of the 2nd Torpedo Squadron. I will be in your care, Admiral.",

    "45": "Admiral, it is 1500. Being part of the 2nd Torpedo Squadron is a great pride, but it makes me nervous. Yes...",
    "46": "Admiral, it is 160... Suzukaze! It must be tiring. You are full of energy. Ehehe, keep it up!",
    "47": "Admiral, it is 1700. Ah... What is it Michishio? Eh? Asashio ? I haven't seen her... are you searching for her?",
    "48": "Admiral, it is 1800. Umikaze will start preparing the dinner. I wonder what would be good tonight?",
    "49": "Admiral, it is 1900. Your evening meal is ready. Tonight's menu is chicken rice. How is it? Is it good?",
    "50": "Admiral, it's 2000. Hm, Kawakaze? You're sortieing with Sendai for a night battle? Ah... be careful! Do your best!",
    "51": "Admiral, it's 2100. Ah... I'm a bit worried about Kawakaze. If anything really happened...",

Maybe it would be faster to say that I was the strongest battleship to be ever born in the country of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity? That's a given, especially considering those quadruple turrets...

    "18": "Night... I'll give it a shot.",
    "19": "Hah!",
    "20": "Hurgh! You!",
    "21": "What? A torpedo? ...A U-boat? I won't sink again!",
    "22": "I see... I'm sinking again... I guess... that's just how it goes... Admiral... Bye...",
    "23": "Me? ...I see, I accept. In honour of Her Majesty the Queen and you.",
    "24": "What's wrong, Admiral? Your cheeks are a bit flushed. You're running a temperature too. Do you have a cold? You best get some rest. ...Ah, this is for me? Understood, I'll open it later. First, you need to get lots of rest. Go on.",
    "25": "Her Majesty's ship, Ark Royal. I was commissioned as a full fleet carrier. I participated in many operations in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. It was these deadly Swordfish that ended the pursuit of that battleship Bismarck. U-boats? They're dangerous. You need to be careful of underwater enemies.",
    "26": "There is no one here.",
    "27": "Thank you very much indeed. Alright.",
    "28": "Are you tired, Admiral? I'll go get some black tea. Wait a moment. I'll get some very fragrant Earl Grey. Go on, get some rest. I'll bring it over so please wait.",
    "29": "Ah, that's right! It's not a problem if they're outdated. If there are no enemy fighters, my Swordfish are good enough for the job. It's not performance that matters, but the results on the battlefield. Admiral? ...Ah, he's not listening huh?",
    "30": "Admiral. That's right, I'll be in charge today. Hmm, what is it? It can't be that you're not happy with that?",
    "31": "It’s 1. What?",
    "32": "It's 2. What? You couldn't be unhappy about something?",
    "33": "It's 3. I see, that's fine then. Sorry. I'm sorry I doubted you, Admiral. So that was it...",
    "34": "It's 4. Almost morning huh. I'll get some black tea. Are you fine with Darjeeling? Alright.",
    "35": "Good morning, Admiral. It's 5. I don't really like mornings but, the mornings here are nice!",
    "36": "It's 6. Good morning. ...Fleet, all hands assemble! Alright, I remember now.",
    "37": "It's 7. Breakfast is toast with mushrooms, tomato and baked beans, hashed brown with black pudding and... How would you like your eggs?",
    "38": "It's 8. Alright, it's almost time to begin prepartions for the fleet to sortie right? Hmmm... Oh, wait... That's....",
    "39": "It's 9. There's big trouble, Admiral! Isn't that a U-boat!? It's dangerous! Fleet, prepare for anti-sub combat! My planes, begin evacuation procedures!",
    "40": "It's 10. What? I'm wrong? I-type? It's a friendly I-type submarine you say? I-I see. Now that you tell me, I can see the difference. S-so that's it...",
    "41": "It's 11. Wait a minute, what about her? Isn't she a U... What? She's a Ro-type from our fleet you say? What?",
    "42": "It is noon. I got hungry after being surprised around every corner. No, it's fine. I brought some sandwiches along just for this occasion. Warspite made them. Come on, let's eat!",
    "43": "It's 1. Were the sandwiches delicious? That Warspite is pretty skilled with her hands. Is that so? Alright, I'll ask her to do it next time.",
    "44": "It's 2. Isn't that... Isn't that Bismarck? Did she join us here on this sea too? She's an ally! Oi, Oiii~! Ah, why's she running away!? Wait!",
    "45": "It's 3. Oi Bismarck, why are you running away? I got no choice, Swordfish squadron, take off! Stop her in her tracks! Go!",
    "46": "It's 4. She got away this time. That Bismarck, having her escorts covering her with CAP planes... how clever... Well, I guess it's fine anyway.",
    "47": "It's 5. Sunset huh? The sunset here is beautiful. Sunsets in the Mediterrenean were beautiful too but... Here is beautiful too.",
    "48": "It's 6. Actually, Hiryuu and Souryuu invited me for dinner tonight. Let's go together. It seems to be some sort of pub. If I recall, it's called \"Mamiya\".",
    "49": "It's 7. This is delicious! Souryuu, what dish is this? Is it chicken? Oooh, it's turkey. Oooh... and this is? Curry? Ah, Indian food?",
    "50": "It's 8. Even if it's delicious, aren't you eating a bit too much, Hiryuu? Oh, you'll be getting some exercise after this so this much is fine? Is that so? That's great!",
    "51": "It's 9. That was delicious, but I ate a bit too much. Hiryuu was amazing. But I'm not going to follow her example. Ah, the Italian girls are making a fuss over there. Shall I go tell them to keep it down? No?",
    "52": "It's 10. The Torpedo Squadrons in this fleet are really active at night. They're being hunter-killers huh. What? I'm wrong? Then what are those girls doing?",
    "53": "It's 11.You work hard every day, Admiral. Please get some rest. Good night. Sleep well."

    "20": "Ahhhhh! This is...!",
    "21": "It's not like I took a torpedo! I'm not... gonna sink!",
    "22": "It can't be. I'm... Sinking again. Matsukaze... Where are you? Why didn't you... Search for me...",
    "23": "Now look at me! The number one is me Asakaze right? My eloquentness and training is on a different level! Eh, Commander? Why are you laughing? Why!?",
    "24": "What is it Commander, calling me to a place like this. I'm quite busy right now you know. You know with convoy escorts and other escorts. Eh, what is this. For me...? W-well I'll accept it. C-cuz it's beautiful... And the size is just right...",
    "25": "I am Asakaze, the second ship of the Kamikaze-class destroyers. Born in Nagasaki. Along with my sisters Harukaze and others, I formed the historic Fifth Destroyer Division. The flagship is naturally me. Participated in battles in the early stages of a war and strategy. Of course, I carried out also the important convoy escort firmly-strictly. Yeah... Went ahead, and tried everything!",
    "26": "Well, I guess it's like this!",
    "27": "Well, I'll accept it. Cuz it's neccesary.",
    "28": "What is this? You're so sloppy. You're tired just by this? (sigh), Commander these days aren't you slacking a bit? There's no choice, let me give you some fighting spirit. Face your face this way. Alright? Close your eyes. ... Ah, you opened them! you opened your eyes! I won't do it anymore!",
    "29": "I'm bored. Harukaze, don't you get sleepy talking like that? Just look at Matsukaze. Ah. Matsukaze you're wearing that hat again. It will get in the way during combat, you should take it off. Ah what? What is it, you want to fight me? Bring it on! I'm not going to hold back!"

    "43": "1300. So how was it? Hm, I guess you didn't have enough vegetables. Fresh vegetables are important, you know?",
